## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox/Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front End Framework
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - Data API
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation Library

### What I learned

I learned a lot during this project specially with the APIs sending an http request, handling error and loading data. i also learn some things about SVGs like animations and more possibilities.

### Continued development

Maybe i will tackle about state management, authentication in my next project. I was thinking of looking into Redux and Firebase.
